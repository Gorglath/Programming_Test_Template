## Match Gems Test Project
This project is a very simple version of a matching game using unity 6000.0.34f.

- No need to build the project, will be tested inside the editor.
- The basic functionality is coded.

## Tasks
- Create a new gem type called bomb.
    - Implement a new behaviour for it which once clicked destroys all surrounding gems.
- The game is too clunky.
    - Figure out a way to sequencly excecute the matching of the gems.
    - Use any library you would like or unity standalone functionality.
- Configuring this game is annoying.
    - Transfer the serialized fields into a file which then can be parsed to read the data, can be any type.
- Bonus : Matching accross the board is not fun, only match neighbours and only if you match x or more.

You have five hours for this test, make sure to use this repository as a template.
